        Flattens a list of voters, i.e., their utilities over projects, into
        two lists of projects and total utilities by aggregating votes using
        some welfare function to be maximised.

        Parameters:
            - voters (List[PBVoter]): A list of PBVoter objects containing the
            voters and specifically their utilities over projects.
            - projects (List[PBProject]): An optional list of PBProject objects
            containing the projects. If this is provided, then all projects
            in the election will be considered, even if they have no votes.
            Otherwise, only those projects with votes will be considered.
