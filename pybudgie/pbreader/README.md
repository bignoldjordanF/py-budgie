## Files Source

The pbreader.py file contains code from http://pabulib.org to parse their provided .pb files, which contain large real-world participatory budgeting instances. The website exists to "foster meaningful research on PB, in particularly by helping the computational social choice community to offer better aggregation methods to be used in real-world instances of PB".
